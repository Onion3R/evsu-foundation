          <h1>History of Eastern Visayas State University</h1>
          <p>
            The Eastern Visayas State University had its humble beginnings in
            1907, as a part of the Leyte Provincial School. It became a separate
            entity in 1915, and was named the Leyte Trade School, funded by the
            provincial government. In 1953, after 38 years, it was renamed the
            National Provincial Trade School by virtue of Republic Act No. 406
            and funded jointly by the National and Provincial Government to
            cover a wider curriculum. In 1961, the Congress of the Philippines
            passed Republic Act No. 1561, converting the school into the Leyte
            Regional School of Arts and Trades, authorizing it to become a
            training institution for vocational and industrial education in
            Eastern Visayas.[3] On June 19, 1965, Republic Act 4572 was enacted
            by Congress of the Philippines which converted the school further
            into a chartered college, renaming it the Leyte Institute of
            Technology.[4] It took effect beginning school year 1965-66.
            Starting in 1999, the institute has grown to establish a satellite
            campus in Ormoc City. Pursuant to Board Resolutions No. 59, series
            of 1999, two CHED supervised institutions (CSIs) in Leyte, namely
            the Leyte College of Arts and Trades and the Burauen Polytechnic
            College were integrated to the Leyte Institute of Technology. The
            LIT Dulag Campus started in SY 2000â€“2001. The Carigara School of
            Fisheries was added, the second phase of CSIs institution to SUCs.
            On August 7, 2004, Republic Act No. 9311 was passed converting the
            Leyte Institute of Technology, into Eastern Visayas State
            University.[5]
